# Kia Ora, I'm Humaid

## I'm a web developer based in Auckland, always eager for a challenge and new learning opportunities. 


- I've recently completed a 15 week course at [DevAcademy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/course-details/) in Full Stack Web Development, it was a wonderful journey, and reinforced my interest and passion for software development. We learnt about, but not limited to React, Node Js, Express Router and Typescript.

</br>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [HomePage2](https://github.com/humaid-memee/HomePage2), a personal project to create a fully customizable homepage, that allows for resizing, moving, adding and removing components.

</br>

 - ðŸ‘¯ For my final group project at DevAcademy, I worked on [Clicky](https://github.com/humaid-memee/clicky), a browser game which allows you to train your mouse skills, useful for video gamers. While working on this project, I focused mostly on state management, utilising custom hooks, as well as end to end testing, utilising [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

   - My group also participated in a Hackathon, were we learnt how to utilise [socket.io](https://socket.io/) in an effort to make Clicky a multiplayer game. We're still on our way to achieving our MVP, but have learned so much about web sockets in the process.
